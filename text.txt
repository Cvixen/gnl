To be able to manage multiple file descriptors with your get_next_line. For
example, if the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5 are accessible for reading, then you can
call get_next_line once on 3, once on 4, once again on 3 then once on 5 etc.
without losing the reading thread on each of the descriptors.
We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done
after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.
